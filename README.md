# Medical-chatbot
The above medical chatbot has an interactive chat window that connects with the patient and gives them the feel as if theyare talking to a person.
The chatbot provides a question and answer pattern to the user and asks them about the symptoms, intensity of the symptoms, number of days they are facing those symptoms and finally the chatbot gives a diagnosis.
The user gets the idea about which specialist they shouldvisit and the severity of their situation can also be understood by them.
